# seocities
a really bad neocities clone
# what is this for?
this is just a fun project i made to see how much i suck at php.
# should i use this unironically?
no, this is not a program to make a "make a website" type thing, this was just for fun and there might be vulnerabilities i might not even know of.
# progress
currently its not done but it will be finished when it's ready
